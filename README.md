This repository contains my practice programs for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++.
It includes beginner to intermediate level problems on arrays, strings, sorting, recursion, and more.

The purpose of this repo is to track my learning progress, organize code by topic, and share it publicly for reference.
